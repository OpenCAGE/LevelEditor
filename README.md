# Alien: Isolation Level Editor

A work-in-progress project to build a 3D companion to OpenCAGE's Commands Editor. The two tools should be used alongside eachother: enable the Unity connection to start a websocket between them.

This tool will eventually become a part of [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE), but for now it exists in its own repo until it is more feature complete.
